# âœ¨ Contributing to Oasis

### Initial Steps:

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine
2. Make sure you have `yarn` installed. If you don't, run `npm install -g yarn`
3. Install all packages with the `yarn` command in the project root.
4. Make a new firebase project. Get the credidentials :)
5. Make a `.env` file in [`api`](/packages/api) and [`web`](/packages/web) based on [`api env.example`](/packages/api/.env.example) and [`web env.example`](/packages/web/.env.example) respectively

Once you are setup, you can head to the indivdual docs for the section of Oasis that you're working on!

- [`WEB.md`](/docs/packages/WEB.md) - How to get started with running/building the Next.JS frontend.
- [`API.md`](/docs/packages/API.md) - How to get started with running/building the GraphQL backend.
- [`CLIENT_GQL.md`](/docs/packages/CLIENT_GQL.md) - How to get started with running/building the client-side GraphQL hooks.

## Next Steps + Useful Info:

- You can start the development server **for all the workspaces** using `yarn run dev` in the project root!
- Each section (_package_) in Oasis has a start script in the project root, as well as in the individual project folders!
  - `yarn run dev:web` will only run the Next.JS frontend!
  - `yarn run dev:gql` will only run the dev compiler for the client-side GQL Hooks!
  - Run `yarn run` in the root of the project to see the rest of the development scripts!
  - Build scripts are currently only in the individual project folders.
- We are using Yarn as our package manager, please do not commit your `package-lock.json` files from NPM
- Everytime you change the .env file in `packages/web`, you will need to restart the Next.JS server.
- Make sure you are upto date by doing `git pull` here and there.
- Submit a <a href="https://github.com/heybereket/oasis/pulls">pull request</a>!
